<!-- Well, it seems that WebStorm is the fastest JetBrains IDE I have been
using so far...-->
<!--
  In this codelab, you will learn how to build a simple "teachable machine",
  a custom image classifier that you will train on the fly in the browser
  using TensorFlow.js, a powerful and flexible machine learning library for
  Javascript.

  You will first load and run a popular pre-trained model called MobileNet
  for image classification in the browser.
  You will then use a technique called "transfer learning",
  which bootstraps our training with the pre-trained MobileNet model
  and customizes it to train for your application.

only a simple <div> to display the outputs from the MobileNet model -->

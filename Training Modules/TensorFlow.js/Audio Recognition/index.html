<!--
In this codelab, you will build an audio recognition network and
use it to control a slider in the browser by making sounds.
You will be using TensorFlow.js, a powerful and flexible machine learning
library for Javascript.

First, you will load and run a pre-trained model that can recognize
20 speech commands. Then using your microphone, you will build and train
a simple neural network that recognizes your sounds and makes the slider
go left or right.

[I think I have already cloned this repository!]

   We've added three buttons to our UI labeled "Left", "Right", and "Noise",
   corresponding to the three commands we want our model to recognize.
   Pressing these buttons calls our newly added collect() function,
   which creates training examples for our model.

  <!--
   Collect "onmousedown," and stop collecting "onmouseup"
   See how we call a JavaScript function by referencing to a string,
   out of all things?
